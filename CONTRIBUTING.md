##Reporting a bug

1. Look for any related issues [here](https://github.com/daffl/mysam/issues).
2. If you find an issue that seems related, please comment there instead of creating a new issue. If it is determined to be a unique bug, we will let you know that a new issue can be created.
3. If you find no related issue, create a new issue by clicking [here](https://github.com/daffl/mysam/issues/new).
If we find an issue that's related, we will reference it and close your issue, showing you where to follow the bug.
4. Tell us important details like what operating system you are using.
5. Include any errors that may be displayed.
6. Update us if you have any new info, or if the problem resolves itself!
